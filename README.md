# Dark-Rings-Detection

A project to summarize my attempt at finding and marking the dark rings in an image. 

## About..

Corneal topography is the technique by which exact physical features and curvature of corneal surface are measured and graphically represented. Clinicians have long recognized the importance of the refractive qualities of the cornea. It is clear that the regularity of curvature of the cornea affects the eyeâ€™s ability to bend light and, therefore visual performance.
So, this project is about detecting those  illuminated Placido rings.

### Analysis:

The project successfully detects the points on the rings which can be further plotted or measured on the basis of width, radius etc.
